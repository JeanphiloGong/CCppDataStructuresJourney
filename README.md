# C, C++, and Data Structures Journey

Welcome to my personal learning repository, where I document my journey through learning C, C++, and data structures. Here, you'll find a collection of notes, code snippets, exercises, and valuable resources that have aided me on this path.

## Introduction

This repository is structured to facilitate both my learning process and anyone else interested in the fundamentals and advanced concepts of C, C++, and data structures. My goal is to create a comprehensive resource that can help beginners and intermediate learners.

## Contents

- **C Basics**: Introduction to C programming, covering variables, data types, control structures, arrays, and functions.
- **C++ Foundations**: Diving into C++ with classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and Standard Template Library (STL) usage.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations and explanations of various data structures in C and C++, including linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- **Exercises**: Practical exercises and solutions to apply the concepts learned.
- **Resources**: Curated list of books, websites, and online courses that have been instrumental in my learning journey.
