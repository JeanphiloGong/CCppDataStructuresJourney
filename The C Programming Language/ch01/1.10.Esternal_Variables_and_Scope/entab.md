[200~Writing a program to replace strings of blanks with tabs and blanks efficiently involves considering the positions of tab stops in your output. In this context, tab stops are fixed intervals at which the cursor moves when a tab character is encountered, simplifying the representation of white space. A common setting for tab stops is every 8 characters, which we'll use in this example.

When deciding whether to use a tab or a single blank to reach a tab stop, prefer a tab for efficiency and to minimize file size. Tabs take up less space than multiple blanks and can be more quickly interpreted by the human eye as alignment rather than spacing.

Here's a simple version of an `entab` program in C. This program reads input line by line, counting spaces and replacing them with the minimal combination of tabs and spaces needed to maintain the same formatting, with preference given to tabs when reaching a tab stop.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define TABSIZE 8 // Define the number of characters between tab stops

int main() {
    int c, nb, nt, pos;

    nb = 0; // Number of blanks necessary
    nt = 0; // Number of tabs necessary
    pos = 1; // Current position in the line

    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
        if (c == ' ') {
            if (pos % TABSIZE != 0)
                ++nb; // Increment the number of blanks
            else {
                nb = 0; // Reset count of blanks
                ++nt; // One more tab
            }
        } else {
            // Output tabs and spaces needed
            while (nt > 0) {
                --nt;
                putchar('\t'); // Output a tab
            }
            if (c == '\t') // Forget the blank(s) because a tab is here
                nb = 0;
            else // Output the remaining blanks if any
                while (nb > 0) {
                    --nb;
                    putchar(' ');
                }
            putchar(c);
            if (c == '\n')
                pos = 0;
            else if (c == '\t')
                pos = pos + (TABSIZE - (pos-1) % TABSIZE) - 1;
        }
        ++pos;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This program works by keeping track of the position in the line (`pos`) and incrementing it for each character read. When a space is encountered, it checks if adding that space would reach a tab stop. If it does, it increases the tab counter (`nt`) and resets the space counter (`nb`). If a non-space character is encountered, it first outputs any accumulated tabs, then any accumulated spaces, before finally outputting the character itself. If a newline or tab character is encountered, the position is adjusted accordingly to account for the reset line length or the movement to the next tab stop.

This approach gives preference to tabs over single spaces when reaching a tab stop, as requested.
