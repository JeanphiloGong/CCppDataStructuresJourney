When writing a program like `detab`, which replaces tabs with the appropriate number of blanks up to the next tab stop, you'll want to decide whether the tab stop size, `n`, should be a variable or a symbolic parameter. The choice depends on how flexible you want your program to be:

- **Variable**: If `n` is a variable, your program can easily adjust to different tab sizes based on user input or file settings. This is more flexible and generally more useful in real-world scenarios where different files might have different tab settings.
- **Symbolic Parameter (Macro)**: If `n` is a symbolic parameter defined at compile time (e.g., using a `#define` directive), the program will be simpler but less flexible. You would have to recompile the program to change the tab size.

For most practical purposes, making `n` a variable that can be set by the user (either as a command-line argument or through some form of input) makes the program more versatile.

Below is a simple version of the `detab` program in C, where `n` is treated as a variable. This program reads input line by line and replaces tabs with the correct number of spaces, assuming a fixed tab stop size defined by the user:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAXLINE 1000  // Maximum input line size

// Prototype declarations
int getLine(char line[], int maxline);
void detab(char to[], char from[], int tabWidth);

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    char line[MAXLINE];  // current input line
    char detabbedLine[MAXLINE]; // line with tabs replaced by spaces
    
    int tabWidth = 4; // Default tab width
    if (argc > 1) {
        tabWidth = atoi(argv[1]); // Set tab width from command line argument
    }

    while (getLine(line, MAXLINE) > 0) {
        detab(detabbedLine, line, tabWidth);
        printf("%s", detabbedLine);
    }
    return 0;
}

// getLine: read a line into s, return length
int getLine(char s[], int lim) {
    int c, i;
    for (i = 0; i < lim-1 && (c = getchar()) != EOF && c != '\n'; ++i)
        s[i] = c;
    if (c == '\n') {
        s[i] = c;
        ++i;
    }
    s[i] = '\0';
    return i;
}

// detab: replace tabs in 'from' with spaces in 'to'; assume 'to' is big enough
void detab(char to[], char from[], int tabWidth) {
    int i, j, k;

    for (i = j = 0; from[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        if (from[i] == '\t') {
            int spaceCount = tabWidth - (j % tabWidth);
            for (k = 0; k < spaceCount; k++, j++) {
                to[j] = ' ';
            }
        } else {
            to[j] = from[i];
            j++;
        }
    }
    to[j] = '\0';
}
```

This program includes a `main` function that optionally accepts the tab width as a command-line argument. If no argument is provided, it defaults to 4. The program reads lines of input, replaces tabs with spaces using the `detab` function, and prints the modified lines. 

Note: The `getLine` function is used here to read input lines; its name is intentionally chosen to avoid conflict with the standard library's `getline` function on some platforms.
